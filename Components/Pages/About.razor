        <p>This is a macro tracker app, designed by yours truly Andreas Ã˜. Christoffersen.</p>
        <h3><u>The database</u></h3>
        <p>The database is run by Neon.Tech, on a free subscription. As a result, you might get a "Your project has
            exceeded the data transfer quota. Upgrade your plan to increase limits". I am currently figuring out how to
            host my own Postgres server with Proxmox.</p>
        <p>The Database setup is can be seen pictured below:</p>
