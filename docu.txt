- "GetIngredientsAsync"
Fuck. What you want to do is "unwrap" the array. That way, you can access the elements of the array directly.
This is to my knowledge the only way of getting the elements of an array, directly.

- InsertMacros.
When ever you squery into a database with custom types, use ROW and ::[TYPE].

-- First, set the sequence to start from 1
ALTER SEQUENCE my_table_id_seq RESTART WITH 1;

-- Optionally set the sequence to the maximum current id + 1 to avoid conflicts in a populated table
SELECT setval('my_table_id_seq', (SELECT MAX(id) FROM my_table) + 1);

- CSS.
Background-color is for the background color and just color is for the color of the text.

- Deleting row and sorting the ids.
These three queries resets the id order correctly. Remember to delete the temporary table:
CREATE TEMP TABLE temp_recipes AS
SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY id) as new_id
FROM recipes;
UPDATE recipes
SET id = temp_recipes.new_id
FROM temp_recipes
WHERE recipes.id = temp_recipes.id;
SELECT setval('recipes_id_seq', (SELECT MAX(id) FROM recipes));
